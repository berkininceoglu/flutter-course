Addaptive: Adapting UI to different OS.
Android is the flutter's main target since it is developed by Google developers.

Android: Material Design whereas iOS: Cupertino Look
Animations and Fonts are also in the subject.

One Codebase >> One Widget Tree >> Different Leaves (if Platform.isIOS) ->iOS Subtree
																		->Android Subtree
Fixed styling should be a thing to avoid.

final curScaleFactor = MediaQuery.of(context).textScaleFactor 
=> means how much texts are in the app scaled according to user's device settings.

Code below would be a better solution to give text a font size. =>
Text('This changes!', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20 * curScaleFactor));

import flutter/services.dart
void main() {
	WidgetsFlutterBinding.enstureInitialized();
	SystemChrome.setPrefferedOrientations([
		DeviceOrientation.portraitUp,
		DeviceOrientation.portraitDown,
		]);
	runApp(MyApp());
}
